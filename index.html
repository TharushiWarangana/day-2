                    Ellalan- an invading South Indian ruler- in 162 BC is depicted with a banner containing a lion
                    figure carrying a sword in its right forepaw, a symbol of the Sun and one of the Moon.[1] This flag
                    was known as the only ancient representation of the lion flag of the Sinhalese but in 1957, the lion
                    figure on it was defaced by a vandal.[2]</td>

                <td style="background-color: aqua; color: black;">This basic design continued to be in use until 1815, when the Kandyan Convention ended the reign of
                    the country's last native monarch, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, replacing his royal standard (used as the
                    Flag of the Kingdom of Kandy) with the Union Flag as the nation's accepted flag.[3] The government
                    of British Ceylon later established its own flag, while Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's standard was taken
                    to England and kept at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.[3]</td>
